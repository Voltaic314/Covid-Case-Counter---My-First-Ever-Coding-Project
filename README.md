# Covid-Case-Counter---My-First-Ever-Coding-Project

This program runs just a few quick steps. 

1. go to worldodometer website that lists the number of total global covid cases
2. grab number of cases
3. post that case number to FB. 

It's really that simple. In all honesty I probably should have just used their API but it was my first programming project so I wanted just to do something that could help me test the waters. 

I'm really happy that I succeeded with this project and succeeded with subsequent projects because things turned out really well for me in computer science and python after doing this. 

Sometimes in life, all you really need is a nice, good start to something. In doing so, your mind is primed for a good future ahead of you. Starting something with a bad foundation is a quick way to make you hate something. 

Anyways, I'm posting this code here, unedited and un-refactored. It's messy and bad spaghetti code, but I'm posting it here because it was the first bit of code I had ever written. My first real project.
